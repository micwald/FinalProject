# FinalProject
  This is a project of Group 8 for the courses of Physical Prototyping and Programming II. 
  
  In this Git Repository we present our Prototypes that are build, 
  on the base of https://github.com/ClintH/interactivity/tree/master/websockets.
  
  All of the prototypes can be found in the Prototypes folder, and to run each one of them, follow the instruction of the README.md in that folder.
